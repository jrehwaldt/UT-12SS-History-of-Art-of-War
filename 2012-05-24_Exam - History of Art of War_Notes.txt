The
==> ultimate strategic objective of IO is to deter (abhalten)
    a potential or actual adversary
or other target audience from taking actions that threaten US national interests

attack points: 
- physical dimension (measuring)
- informational dimension (processing)
- cognitive dimension (decision making)


IO can affect data, information, and knowledge in three basic ways:
 - by taking specific psychological, electronic,
   or physical actions that add, modify, or remove
   information from the environment of various individuals
   or groups of decision makers.
 - by taking actions to affect the infrastructure that
   collects, communicates, processes, and/or stores information
   in support of targeted decision makers.
 - by influencing the way people receive, process, interpret,
   and use data, information, and knowledge.

Types of influence: Destroy. Disrupt. Degrade. Deny. + 6 more :P

Problems:
- coordination is huge problem, long chain of command
- perceive foreign cultures
- shortage in manpower
- openness of society

IW is less destructive and more controllable

China's view:
- Psychologic Warfare
- Media Warfare (manipulate media)
- Legal Warfare (find support for China friendly international laws)

IW is primary form of warfare

Russia's view:
- control society
- demoralize enemy
- gathering intelligence
- attack enemy

- to low priority on IW for to many goals
- Russia tries to go one step further and manipulate biological parts
  of enemy
